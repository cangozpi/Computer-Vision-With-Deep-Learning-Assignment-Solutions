# Computer Vision With Deep Learning Assignment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the assignments of Computer Vision With Deep Learning (Comp-411) Lecture offered in Koc University. These assignments are mostly modified versions of the Stanford's cs231n course assignments.

### <i> cs231-n outline <i>:
* <u> Assignment 1 (10%)</u>: Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Fully-Connected Neural Network

* <u> Assignment 2 (20%)</u>: Fully-Connected Nets, Batch Normalization, Dropout, Convolutional Nets
* <u> Assignment 3 (20%)</u>: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, Network Visualization, Generative Adversarial Networks </u>

<u> <b> Note that the assignments here do not exactly follow the outline below. For a more accurate outline check out the individual README.md files in these assignment folders. </u> </b>
